# Anomoly-Detection

Supervised Machine Learning techniques for Anomaly Detection require previously tagged data. Manually
tagging the points as Anomaly or not an Anomaly is time consuming and prone to manual error. We are building
multiple unsupervised Anomaly detection models that can perform anomaly detection in any time series data
without the need of manual tagging the data. We have selected our algorithms in such a way that they could be
scaled to multidimensional data with minimal modifications.To measure the performance of our unsupervised
models we have identified the anomalous points from the Yahoo Time Series data set and compared them
against the actual labels. We have also used the bench marked the performance of our algorithms using the
credit card data available on Kaggle. In addition to all the models we have also implemented our framework on
frequency of twitter count for a topic in specific time period to identify any anomalous behaviour. If any anomaly
was identified we have tried to explain the driver for those anomalies in the form of bag of words. .
